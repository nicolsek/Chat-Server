# Chat-Server
Simple chat-server built in Node.js and Socket.io!

# Introduction
This is just a simple chat server. It is hosted on a specific port and has a simple little html page created using bootstrap. With that you're able to send messages and recieve them! It is really just a tiny chat-server that I made for learning how to use Node.js and better my superb(ly terrible) bootstrap skills.

# Usage
To use...
```
git clone http://github.com/nicolsek/Chat-server
cd Chat-Server
npm install
npm start
```
